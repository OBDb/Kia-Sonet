    description: "The first generation Kia Sonet was introduced as a subcompact crossover SUV positioned below the Seltos in global markets. Featuring Kia's signature tiger-nose grille with 'heartbeat' LED daytime running lights and a distinctive rear light bar, the Sonet aimed to bring premium styling to the entry-level segment. Depending on the market, it offered multiple powertrain options including a 1.2L naturally aspirated engine, a 1.0L turbocharged gasoline engine, and a 1.5L diesel, with transmission choices spanning from 5-speed manual to 7-speed DCT and iMT (intelligent Manual Transmission). Despite its compact dimensions, the Sonet offered surprisingly premium features like ventilated seats, Bose premium audio, ambient lighting, and a 10.25-inch touchscreen with UVO connected car technology. Safety features included six airbags, ABS, ESC, and various driver assistance systems in higher trims. The first-generation Sonet established itself as a tech-laden, feature-rich option in the highly competitive entry-level crossover segment."

The technology package was enhanced with additional driver assistance features, improved connectivity options, and a more comprehensive digital instrument cluster on higher trims. Powertrain options remained largely similar to the previous iteration but with refinements for improved efficiency. This refresh helped the Sonet remain competitive in the rapidly evolving subcompact crossover segment by incorporating more premium features and technology while maintaining its value proposition."
